CANbus is an unfiltered network
-
ODB to CAN is like SMPT to TCP
-
ECU and ODB have flashing options
-
Test benches can be built to test without car present
-
parts: ECU, wiring diagram
optional: instrument cluster, ignition
-
trick crank senor into thinking it's made a rotation.
this will trick the system into starting.
-
see pic for ODB connector:
Green: CAN signals
power: 12v
Make sure car is running if pulling power.
Puling power here can kill the car in ~20min
-
CAN is twisted pair
CAN uses 2.5V
+-1v to signal
120 ohm
-
Make sure baud is correct when connecting
-
see pic for CAN packet diagram (different per vendor)
-
CANiBUS: CAN sniffing tool
-
optional- pull fuses that you aren't using to keep traffic levels down

to find can signals:
Start up ICSim/icsim
Then start ICSim/controls

Start cansniffer vcan0
Hit some controls and watch cansniffer

New things will show up and add a row to cansniffer
After that new thing hasn't been seen for a while it will
 be removed
When found, turn off controller to quite any extra noise.
While watching icsim, use cansend to resend the packet.

Examples:
Acceleration packet:
198000 244  00 00 00 A3 00      ........
Acceleration command:
cansend vcan0 224#000000A300
